# CLAUDE.md — Auto-loaded by Claude Code

## First Steps (every session)
1. Read `AGENTS.md` for full project instructions and rules
2. Read `memory/STATUS.md` for current project state
3. Read `docs/EXPERTISE.md` for project expertise (auto-generated from Mulch)

## Quick Reference
- **Project:** [Project Name]
- **Tech:** [Tech Stack]
- **Repo:** [GitHub URL]
- **Test account:** see `docs/test-accounts.md`

## Rules
- Update `memory/STATUS.md` after completing any milestone
- Record learnings with `npx mulch-cli record <domain> --type <type>` before ending session
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`
- Never commit secrets (project test accounts in `docs/` are fine)
- Log daily work in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
